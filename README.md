# Radial_Tensor_Kurtosis

In this repository, I am sharing the code to process the radial tensor kurtosis from diffusional kurtosis estimates extracted from DIPY's diffusional kurtosis imaging data fit.

Radial Tensor Kurtosis is defined according to (Hansen et al., 2017)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27539807/].
